editmoin
=========

This is a fork of the very nice editmoin package from Gustavo Niemeyer <gustavo@niemeyer.net> from here: http://labix.org/editmoin

The primary changes include a code change to use the optparse packages for the command line options and adding and option to default to trivial change so notifications are not sent by default.  

Our group uses moinmoin for documenting many parallel project and many of the edits do not need to be broadcast so we make most of our edits trivial changes so colleagues are not spammed with change notifications.
